# pi-system-theme

A Pi extension that syncs Pi's theme with macOS appearance (dark/light mode).

## Behavior

- macOS dark mode -> `darkTheme`
- macOS light mode -> `lightTheme`
- Detection uses:

```bash
/usr/bin/defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle
```

If detection fails or returns an unknown value, the extension keeps the current Pi theme unchanged.

## Defaults (works out of the box)

No config is required.

- `darkTheme`: `dark`
- `lightTheme`: `light`
- `pollMs`: `2000`
- `commandTimeoutMs`: `1200`

## Configuration file (global only)

Path:

- `~/.pi/agent/pi-system-theme.json`

The extension stores only **overrides** in this file. If all values match defaults, the file is removed.

Example:

```json
{
    "darkTheme": "rose-pine",
    "lightTheme": "rose-pine-dawn",
    "pollMs": 2000,
    "commandTimeoutMs": 1200
}
```

## Interactive command

Use `/system-theme` to edit all knobs directly:

1. dark theme name
2. light theme name
3. poll interval (ms)
4. detection timeout (ms)

After saving, the extension writes global overrides and applies changes immediately.

## Notes

- This extension currently only acts on macOS (`process.platform === "darwin"`).
- If a configured theme name is missing, it falls back to Pi built-ins (`dark`/`light`).

## Install
